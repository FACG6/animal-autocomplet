{"African Elephant":{"description":"Mammal. The largest living land mammal, the African elephant weighs 3500 to 7000 kilograms (3.5 to 7 tons) and stands 3.4 meters (11 feet) high. The elephant's remarkable trunk serves variously as a nose, arm, hand, foot and multi-purpose tool. The trunk is strong enough to uproot a tree and delicate enough to pick berries, and it enables the elephant to reach as high as 7 meters (23 feet). Humans can hear only 20% of the vocal sounds an elephant makes; 80% are on low frequencies that are inaudible to our ears. Elephants can walk up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour but cannot jump or run. They are very good swimmers.","image":"https://switchzoo.com/assets/profiles/africanelephant_switchzoo.jpg"},"Dolphin":{"description":"Mammal. Common dolphins are very social, traveling in groups called pods of up to 1,000 animals. Playful and boisterous, they do flips and somersaults, leaping completely out of the water, sometimes as a group. They love to ride on the waves created by their fellow swimmers, ships, or very large whales. They sleep with one eye always open, closing one for 5 to 10 minutes, then the other. Dolphins are intelligent animals and use vocalization to communicate with each other. They are affectionate and form lasting friendships with one another. Dolphins will use their fins to help keep an ailing dolphin afloat so she can breathe.","image":"https://switchzoo.com/assets/profiles/dolphin_switchzoo.jpg"}}
