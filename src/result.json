    "Black Lechwe": {
        "description": "Mammal. A medium-sized antelope, the black lechwe (LEECH-wee) grows to about a meter (3.3 ft) in height, weighing 60 to 128 kg (132 to 282 lb). Unlike other antelope, black lechwe are slow runners but they are good swimmers and are often seen grazing shoulder-deep in water. Their hooves are adapted for swampy areas rather than dry land, and their greasy coats act as a sort of water-proofing but also give off a distinctive odor. Only the males have antlers. They live in dryer areas forming bachelor herds during most of the year. Females and their calves depend on water more than the males and remain closer to it all year round.",

    "Ring-tailed Lemur": {
        "description": "Mammal. Lemurs are primates but developed quite differently from monkeys and apes when Madagascar split from the African continent millions of years ago. Ring-tailed lemurs are unique from other lemurs in that they prefer walking on the ground to swinging through trees. Social and territorial animals, they live in groups of about 12 to 25. The females are in charge and get the best food. Although the adults have bright yellow eyes, their young have blue eyes. Lemurs are noisy, making 15 different kinds of sounds from purrs to clicks to grunts to howls. They also communicate using odor.",
