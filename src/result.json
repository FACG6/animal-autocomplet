{"Black Lechwe":{"description":"Mammal. A medium-sized antelope, the black lechwe (LEECH-wee) grows to about a meter (3.3 ft) in height, weighing 60 to 128 kg (132 to 282 lb). Unlike other antelope, black lechwe are slow runners but they are good swimmers and are often seen grazing shoulder-deep in water. Their hooves are adapted for swampy areas rather than dry land, and their greasy coats act as a sort of water-proofing but also give off a distinctive odor. Only the males have antlers. They live in dryer areas forming bachelor herds during most of the year. Females and their calves depend on water more than the males and remain closer to it all year round.","image":"https://switchzoo.com/assets/profiles/blacklechwe_switchzoo.jpg"},"Black Swallowtail Caterpillar":{"description":"Black Swallowtail Caterpillar Insect. Black swallowtail caterpillars are eating machines, growing from 2 mm (.08 inches) to 4 cm (1.57 inches). All species of swallowtail caterpillars have a special gland that secretes bad-smelling and bad-tasting chemicals to help keep predators away. They molt, or shed their skin, five times. Their coloration and appearance change dramatically as they grow. Many spend the winter season as pupae, a middle stage of development, before finishing their transformation into butterflies in the spring. The adult black swallowtail butterfly looks a lot like a poisonous cousin, the pipevine swallowtail, confusing predators.","image":"https://switchzoo.com/assets/profiles/blackswallowtailcaterpillar_switchzoo.jpg"}}
